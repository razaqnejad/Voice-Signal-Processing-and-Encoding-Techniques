# Voice-Signal-Processing-and-Encoding-Techniques
Implement a voice signal processing system to read, analyze, and play audio files using linear and non-linear PCM encoding, including Î¼-law and A-law algorithms. The project includes developing functions to save and play audio data, visualize signal properties, and apply various modulation methods.
